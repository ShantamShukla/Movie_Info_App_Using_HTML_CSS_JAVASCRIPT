# Movie Information Website
This is a simple movie information website that fetches data from the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API and displays it on the page. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was just a fun mini project in I made in my free time.ðŸ˜Š

## Files
index.html: Contains the HTML code for the website.
style.css: Contains the CSS code for styling the website.
index.js: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching data from the OMDb API and displaying it on the page.
key.js: Contains the API key needed to fetch data from the OMDb API.
## How to Use
To use the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website will display a search box where you can enter the name of a movie. Once you click the "Search" button, the website will fetch data from the OMDb API and display it on the page.
